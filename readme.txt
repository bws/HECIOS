Documentation Notes:
  Documentation is stored in the doc directory, and the UML directory.  In order to build the documentation, simply type make doc at the top level.  To view the UML diagrams, you will need to use the tool ArgoUML available at http://argouml.tigris.org


Integration Notes:
  This simulator utilizes the OmNet++ event framework and the contributed network package: the INET framework.  A compatible snapshot of the inet framework is stored with this simulator under source control.
